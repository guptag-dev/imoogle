A large number of search engine exists today on the web which takes input keyword as a query and display all related links i.e. They performs text based content retrieval , but our aim is bit different viz. Developing a search engine which shall take images as input and reveal all links of web pages where exact image can be found. Project comprises of concepts of Web-Mining , Database-Management and Image-Processing. Web-Mining concept was applied to retrieve images from web. The major concept used was comparison of query image with a large database. This comparison algorithm was developed by us which will distinguish an image within a huge(10^502) database of image with very high efficiency. Besides,clustering of images has been done according to their types and then tables are indexed according to their PiVS in order to reduce time taken in search an image. So this project presents a new way of information retrieval through images and a new way of comparing an image in a large database.
